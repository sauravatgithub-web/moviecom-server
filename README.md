# 🎬 ✅ Moviecom – Watch. Call. Chat. Together.

**Moviecom** is a full-featured, real-time web application that lets users **video call**, **watch movies together**, and **chat simultaneously** — all in one seamless interface. It combines the best of chat apps and streaming platforms, delivering an engaging and interactive experience.

At first glance, it may appear as a regular **Chat App**, but it’s far more powerful:
- Send messages, images, videos, and documents
- Create group chats and manage your profile
- End-to-end encrypted messaging with encrypted storage
- Real-time video calls with friends
- **Synchronized movie playback** between connected users — play, pause, and stop at the same time!

This project is a culmination of everything I’ve learned in web development so far. Built with modern tools, it’s functional, real-time, and creative — though not yet scalable for mass usage.

> 🧠 *Fun Fact*: I built this secretly and was excited to share it — only to realize similar ideas already exist. 😅
